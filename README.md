the source code in "elliptical.js" is a node.js module that uses a library called flocking.js to create a loop-based generative music composition.

the composition consists of a set of 16 voices that all repeat on loops of different lengths, all sine waves at various phases and frequencies.

assuming you have already installed node.js, you should be able to play the piece as follows:

1. git clone https://github.com/kdwade/elliptical.git
2. git pull
3. npm install
4. node elliptical
